# Introduction of OpenMsg

	OpenMsg is an opensource social app messages handler. It can do some helpful
	functions such as auto reply, auto group message sending, and so on.
	In the past, we do group message sending by using some kinds of web api or Restful api.
	But we find it easy to freeze your account. So we need a method to simulate human's action.
